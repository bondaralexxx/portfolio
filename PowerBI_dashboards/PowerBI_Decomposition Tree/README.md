Decomposition Tree Power BI 

Building the Decomposition Tree report, which can use for breakdown analysis.
This is useful  for root cause analysis, allowing users to drill down into data dynamically to see impact of different factors.

For example, in our sales report we can understand:
- who buys more: loyality card castomers or regular customers?
- in which city are the highest sales?
- which product categories are more popular among men, and which among women?
- and others.
