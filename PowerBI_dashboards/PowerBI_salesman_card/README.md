A report that can be used by management to evaluate the effectiveness of the sales team.

The report shows:
- which products sales representative (seller) sells;
- which clients they work with;
- compares actual sales with the previous year;
- presents sales dynamics over time.

The report uses DAX measures and an additional visual that alloows us to compare sales of the current period to the previous year.
